    *  directory that contains the pickled model files<br>
    *  data: directory that contains the data files from Kaggle<br>

Additional Description:

  This is the first time i have participated in a programming competition. Because i have not studied machine learning before, <br>
  the result of this competition was not very good. But i learned many things from it which give me an encouragement. <br>
  I decide to create a new repo to record what i learned and what i will learn about machine learning. I will keep update this repo
